##Evaluation Criteria for Generative AI Tools
Overview
This document outlines the principles and criteria for evaluating generative AI tools used for creating text, image, and video content for webpages. 
The criteria focus on principles of fairness, prediction accuracy, traceability, transparency, privacy, security, and credit.

Criteria and Principles
1. Fairness
1.1 Diverse Representative Data
Description: Evaluate if the AI tool is trained on datasets that include diverse and representative samples from various demographics, cultures, and perspectives.
Rating Questions:
Does the toolâ€™s dataset include a wide range of demographics?
How does the tool ensure cultural and perspective diversity?
Rating Scale: 1 (Poor) - 5 (Excellent)
1.2 Bias Awareness and Mitigation
Description: Assess the measures taken to identify, monitor, and mitigate bias in the generated content.
Rating Questions:
What methods are used to detect bias in the generated content?
How effectively are biases mitigated in the AI's output?
Rating Scale: 1 (Poor) - 5 (Excellent)
2. Prediction Accuracy
2.1 Reliability Over Time
Description: Determine if the AI tool can consistently generate reliable content over multiple uses.
Rating Questions:
Can prompts be reused to generate similar or identical outputs?
How does the tool handle variations in prompts?
Rating Scale: 1 (Unreliable) - 5 (Highly Reliable)
3. Traceability
3.1 Source Attribution
Description: Check if the AI tool provides sources and links for the information used in generating content.
Rating Questions:
Are sources and references provided with the generated content?
How transparent is the tool about its sources?
Rating Scale: 1 (No Traceability) - 5 (Full Traceability)
4. Transparency
4.1 Data Used in Generation
Description: Evaluate the transparency of the data and algorithms used in content generation.
Rating Questions:
Is information about the training data available?
How clear is the documentation regarding the algorithms used?
Rating Scale: 1 (Opaque) - 5 (Transparent)
5. Privacy
5.1 Third-Party Disclosure
Description: Assess if the AI tool discloses data to third parties and how data sharing is managed.
Rating Questions:
Does the tool share data with third parties?
How is user data protected?
Rating Scale: 1 (No Privacy) - 5 (High Privacy)
6. Security
6.1 Vulnerability to Bugs
Description: Check for the presence of security measures and the tool's vulnerability to bugs.
Rating Questions:
Are there robust security measures in place?
How frequently are bugs and security issues reported and fixed?
Rating Scale: 1 (Vulnerable) - 5 (Secure)
7. Credit
7.1 Attribution and Ownership
Description: Determine how the AI tool handles credit for generated content and intellectual property rights.
Rating Questions:
Does the tool provide proper attribution for content?
How are ownership and rights managed for generated content?
Rating Scale: 1 (No Attribution) - 5 (Full Attribution)
