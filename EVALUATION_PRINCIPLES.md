# Evaluation Principles for Generative AI Tools

This document outlines the principles used to evaluate generative AI tools for generating text, image, and video content for webpages.

## Principles

### 1. Fairness
- **Diverse Representative Data**: Assess whether the AI tool is trained on a dataset that represents a wide range of demographics, cultures, and viewpoints.
- **Bias (Awareness and Mitigation)**: Evaluate the awareness of potential biases in the model and the measures taken to mitigate them.

### 2. Prediction Accuracy
- **Reliable Content Over Time**: Determine if the AI tool can consistently generate reliable content. Test if the same or similar prompts produce the same or similar output over multiple instances.
- **Reusability of Prompts**: Verify if prompts can be reused to get consistent results.

### 3. Traceability
- **Sources and Links**: Check if the AI tool provides sources and links for the information it generates. Evaluate the traceability of the content to its original data sources.

### 4. Transparency
- **Data Used in Generation**: Investigate the transparency regarding the data used to train the AI model. Ensure that there is clear information about the datasets and their origins.

### 5. Privacy
- **Third-Party Disclosure**: Confirm if the AI tool discloses any sharing of data with third parties. Ensure that there are clear policies regarding data sharing and user privacy.

### 6. Security
- **Bugs and Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate the AI tool for any bugs or security vulnerabilities. Ensure that the tool is regularly updated and maintained to address potential security issues.

### 7. Credit
- **Attribution**: Assess how the AI tool handles attribution and credit for generated content. Ensure that proper credit is given to original sources and creators where applicable.

## Conclusion
Use these principles to systematically evaluate generative AI tools and ensure they meet the necessary standards for fairness, accuracy, traceability, transparency, privacy, security, and credit.
