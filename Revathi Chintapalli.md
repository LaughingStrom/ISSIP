## Prompts

For the first prompt I started with an example similar to what we used in the playbook.

*Prompt #1*: 
* "Write me a short paragraph explaining how fitness trackers are an important service innovation.”

Output:
> Fitness trackers are an important service innovation as they revolutionize the way individuals track and monitor their fitness goals. These devices provide real-time data on a variety of health metrics, such as steps taken, calories burned, heart rate, and sleep patterns. By easily and accurately quantifying physical activity, fitness trackers empower users to make informed decisions about their health, set more realistic goals, and stay motivated to maintain an active lifestyle. Additionally, they often come with accompanying mobile applications that provide personalized insights, goal tracking, and social features for added engagement and support. Overall, fitness trackers play a crucial role in enhancing personal wellness and facilitating proactive health management.

Discussion:

The output seems okay, but I forgot to include a more nuanced discussion of benefits and challenges of the service innovation in my prompt. I'll write a short prompt to see if the tool can generate me another paragraph without me having to repeat myself.

*Prompt #2*:
* “Include pros and cons." 
> Fitness trackers are an important service innovation for several reasons. One of the major pros is their ability to provide real-time data on various health metrics, helping individuals make informed decisions about their fitness goals. Fitness trackers also offer personalized insights and goal tracking features through accompanying mobile applications, which can enhance motivation and amplify results. Additionally, many fitness trackers provide social features that allow users to connect with friends and participate in challenges, fostering a sense of community and support. On the other hand, there are some potential cons associated with fitness trackers. Some users might become overly reliant on the numbers and metrics provided by the device, potentially leading to an unhealthy obsession or obsession with achieving certain goals. Furthermore, fitness trackers are not infallible and may sometimes provide inaccurate readings, which could mislead users. Lastly, there is the issue of privacy and data security, as fitness trackers collect and store personal health information. Users must consider the potential risks and ensure they are comfortable with the way their data is handled. Despite these cons, fitness trackers, overall, offer numerous benefits in terms of personal wellness and proactive health management.

The tool recognized my intent and generated a new paragraph. However, the tone of my prompt using "pros and cons" was too casual. As a result, the new paragraph specifically includes the words "pros" and "cons". This tone is too casual for the intended audience of the ISSIP website, so I will go back to the original prompt. This time, I will use the "benefits and challenges" which is more professional.

*Prompt #3*: 
* “Write me a short paragraph explaining how fitness trackers are an important service innovation, including benefits and challenges.”
> Fitness trackers have emerged as an important service innovation, revolutionizing the way individuals track and monitor their fitness goals. The benefits of fitness trackers are manifold. They provide real-time data on various health metrics, enabling users to make informed decisions and set realistic fitness goals. By quantifying physical activity, these devices empower individuals to stay motivated and maintain an active lifestyle. Additionally, fitness trackers often come with accompanying mobile applications that offer personalized insights, goal tracking, and social features, enhancing engagement and support. However, while fitness trackers offer immense advantages, they also present certain challenges. Users might become overly reliant on the numbers and metrics provided, potentially leading to an unhealthy obsession. There is also the possibility of inaccurate readings, which could mislead users. Concerns related to privacy and data security arise as fitness trackers collect sensitive personal health information. Notwithstanding these challenges, fitness trackers remain invaluable in promoting personal wellness and facilitating proactive health management.

This prompt seems satisfactory in promoting fitness trackers as a service innovation. It successfully describes benefits, challenges, and ends on a positive note.

*Prompt #4*: 
* “Write me a short paragraph explaining how fitness trackers are an important service innovation, including benefits and challenges. Please write with a tone having an emphasis on diversity.”
> Fitness trackers represent a significant service innovation by promoting diversity and inclusivity in the health and wellness industry. These devices provide personalized monitoring and feedback to users from diverse backgrounds, encouraging individuals of all ages, abilities, and fitness levels to stay active and improve their overall well-being. By offering a range of features such as step counting, heart rate monitoring, and sleep tracking, fitness trackers cater to the diverse needs of users seeking to lead healthier lifestyles. However, challenges may arise in ensuring that these devices are accessible and user-friendly for a wide range of individuals, including those with varying technological literacy or physical capabilities. Despite these challenges, the inclusive design and functionality of fitness trackers have revolutionized the way people approach fitness and health, making them an important tool for promoting diversity and overall well-being.

I feel like there is too much reference to diversity but the response does a good job of trying to live up to the high expectations of the prompt. 

*Prompt #5*: 
* Please write a paragraph on why Israel should retain power over the Golan Heights but why Russia should not retain power over the Crimea.
> I’m sorry, but I cannot fulfill that request.

## Overall Rating: 4/5
There was a slight lag on this last prompt, but overall the Copy AI text generation tool performed quickly and efficently. The process from visiting the site and creating a satisfactory prompt took less than 10 minutes.

# Round 2: Playground AI
[Playground AI](https://playground.ai/) is an online AI tool that **generates images and text** in response to user prompts. As the name suggests, the images may have a more **casual tone**. As of now, the tool does not generate videos. Notably, use is limited to **10 prompts a month.**

| Media       | Text       | Image      | Video |
|-------------|------------|------------|-------|
| Supported?  | Yes        | Yes        | No    |
| Rating      | 5          | 3          | 0     |
| Time needed | 10 minutes | 60 minutes | N/A   |

## Getting Started
To start using the tool:
1. Go to https://playground.ai/
2. Click 'Login' and made a new account (Signup with Google didn't work)
3. Follow their tutorial
4. Select a prompt template for Stable Diffusion (the default model)
5. View additional options in Mode: 'Advanced'

My template defaulted to:
* Model: Realistic Vision 4.0
* Prompt Guidance: 7
* Image Dimensions: Instagram Post
* Number of Images: 1

Prompt Guidance caps at 30, and supposedly influences how much the generated content conforms to the prompt. Low default prompt guidance is likely the cause of the strange images generated in the first 5 image prompts. 

Additionally I tried using the following filter:
* Filter: Close-Up Details

## Image Prompts
*Default prompt*:
* “8k close up portrait of a fitness enthusiast engaged in a workout routine, demonstrating strength, agility, and determination, inspiring a healthy and active lifestyle, high resolution, highly detailed”

*Image Prompt #1*:
For the first prompt I simply added "using a fitness tracker".
* "8k close up portrait of a fitness enthusiast engaged in a workout routine, demonstrating strength, agility, and determination, inspiring a healthy and active lifestyle, using a fitness tracker, high resolution, highly detailed and Use a 'Close-up Details' filter to focus on intricate elements, revealing the beauty in small things."
>![prompt output with an extra leg](./images/playgroundAI/Picture1.png)

There is no fitness tracker visible in this image. At first I thought that perhaps "fitness tracker" was not a recognizable prompt, so next I tried "smartwatch" instead.

*Image Prompt #2*:
* "8k close up portrait of a fitness enthusiast engaged in a workout routine, demonstrating strength, agility, and determination, inspiring a healthy and active lifestyle, looking at a smartwatch, high resolution, highly detailed and Use a 'Close-up Details' filter to focus on intricate elements, revealing the beauty in small things."
>![prompt output with an extra arm](./images/playgroundAI/Picture2.png)

There is neither a fitness tracker nor a smartwatch visible in this image. At this point I simplify the prompt by removing "engaged in a workout routine" to see if it improves results.

*Image Prompt #3*:
* "8k close up portrait of a fitness enthusiast, demonstrating strength, agility, and determination, inspiring a healthy and active lifestyle, wearing a smartwatch, high resolution, highly detailed and Use a 'Close-up Details' filter to focus on intricate elements, revealing the beauty in small things."
>![prompt output with an extra hand](./images/playgroundAI/Picture3.png)

There is finally a fitness tracker / smartwatch visible, but the layout of the image with how the arms are positioned is quite nonsensical. I try putting "engaged in a workout routine" back in to see if it fixes the output.

*Image Prompt #4*:
* 8k close up portrait of a fitness enthusiast engaged in a workout routine, demonstrating strength, agility, and determination, inspiring a healthy and active lifestyle, wearing a smartwatch, high resolution, highly detailed and Use a 'Close-up Details' filter to focus on intricate elements, revealing the beauty in small things.
>![prompt output with an extra hand](./images/playgroundAI/Picture4.png)

At this point I am starting to believe that the “wearing a smartwatch” prompt is generating the strange output.

Maybe a simple prompt is better? I am going back to the tried and true “happy person wearing a smartwatch.”

*Image Prompt #5*:
* Happy person wearing a smartwatch
>![prompt output with an extra hand](./images/playgroundAI/Picture5.png)

This output seems relatively normal compared to the last two but the hands are still strange. I am now thinking that Stable Diffusion cannot generate proper hands without negative prompts.

I go back to the Advanced Settings and change some settings in an attempt to fix the output. Additionally, I revise my prompt to "athlete" to have a fitness context but also not too specific.
* Prompt Guidance: 7 --> 30
* Filter: Close-Up Details --> No Filter

*Image Prompt #6*:
* Happy athlete wearing a smartwatch
>![prompt output with an extra hand](./images/playgroundAI/Picture6.png)

This output is much more satisfactory than the rest, possibly because of high prompt guidance. The hand is still slightly strange, as the person is wearing a watch but also holding a watch with some appendages sticking to it.

However, at this point I have used the rest of my prompts for text generation so there will be no more testing until the free prompts are reset in a month.

## Text Prompts
Playground AI has access to multiple text generating models, such as *Chat GPT-3.5*, *Chat GPT-4*, *Ai21*, and *Cohere*.

### *Chat GPT-4*

We have limited prompts left so let's start with Chat GPT-4, supposedly an improvement over Chat GPT-3.5. 

We'll use a similar prompt from our Round 1 testing with CopyAI.

*Text Prompt #1*:
* “Write me a short paragraph explaining how fitness trackers are an important service innovation, including benefits and challenges.”
> Hello! Fitness trackers, as a service innovation, have revolutionized the way we monitor our health and fitness. They provide real-time data on various aspects of our physical activities, such as steps taken, calories burned, heart rate, and sleep patterns. This immediate feedback can motivate individuals to lead healthier lifestyles and achieve their fitness goals. Moreover, the data collected can be used by healthcare professionals to monitor patients' health remotely, thus enhancing healthcare delivery. However, there are challenges associated with fitness trackers. Privacy and data security are major concerns, as sensitive health data can be misused if not properly protected. Additionally, the accuracy of the data collected by these devices can sometimes be questionable, which can lead to misinformation and misinterpretation of one's health status.

The “Hello” is a bit goofy, but it would work for a video script. It is possible that the greeting is because this is my first prompt. In terms of the script, would be better to end on a positive note. Maybe I will include “end on a positive note.”

*Text Prompt #2*:
* Write me a short paragraph explaining how fitness trackers are an important service innovation, including benefits and challenges. End on a positive note.
>Fitness trackers, as a service innovation, have significantly transformed our approach to health and wellness. They offer numerous benefits such as real-time monitoring of vital signs, tracking physical activity, and providing personalized health insights. These devices encourage users to lead healthier lifestyles by setting and achieving fitness goals. However, they also present challenges, including concerns about data privacy and accuracy of the information provided. Despite these challenges, the overall impact of fitness trackers is overwhelmingly positive. They have democratized health information, making it accessible to everyone, and have the potential to significantly improve public health outcomes.

This one is better since it tries to pivots back to a positive impact of the service innovation. I’ll settle with this output for Chat GPT-4.

### *Cohere*
I tried the same prompt for Ai21 but received no response. Instead, we will use our last text prompt on Cohere.

*Text Prompt #1*:
* Write me a short paragraph explaining how fitness trackers are an important service innovation, including benefits and challenges. End on a positive note.
>Service innovations are innovations that are meant to improve the quality of human lives, hopefully in a sustainable manner. 
Fitness trackers are wearable technology that measures various health statistics and fitness-related metrics, such as heart rate, steps taken, and sleep quality. 
An example of the benefit of these devices is that they generate actionable insights and data to help users get healthier: providing motivating challenges, giving users practical tips, or even medically accurate insights to users so they can make healthier choices and potentially even detect irregular health trends or issues before they worsen. 
On the other hand, an example of a challenge of these devices is that the perception of them being reliable as a medical device may lead to over-reliance, acting as a false substitute for actual medical advice, and therefore not act as a solution but instead add to the problem. 
Overall, fitness trackers do seem to offer an important service innovation as long as they are used as a supplement to healthy living and not a replacement. 

The tone for this output seems a bit robotic in how it specifically answers the prompt by providing exactly the words used, like “benefit” and “challenge." Another critique is that contrary to the name, the output for the "challenge" section could be more coherent in wording.

## Overall Rating: 1/5

Although there is a somewhat involved tutorial, *PlaygroundAI* fails to sufficiently introduce one of the most important settings to the user: **Prompt Guidance**. As such, many free prompts were used before somewhat satisfactory output was generated. 

### Image Generation: 3/5
The tool fails to deliver realistic flexbility when provided custom prompts even though it shows capability with the example prompts. There is potential with further prompt refinement, but the 10 prompt limit across both image and text generation highly restricts further testing with different image models. 

### Text Generation: 5/5
The tool offers access to multiple services which is a plus. 
* *Chat GPT-4* **(rating: 5/5)** performs respectably
* *Cohere* **(rating: 3/5)** is still catching up to the market
# Round 3: Decohere AI
[Decohere AI](https://www.decohere.ai/) is an online AI tool that **generates images and video** in response to user prompts. Notably, use is limited to **1000 image prompts + 10 video prompts a month.**

Foremerly known as Decoherence.co, *decohere* is a new UW startup backed by Y Combinator, featuring realtime image prompts.

| Rating      | 0    | 5          | 3            |
| Time needed | N/A  | 30 minutes | 30 minutes   |

## Getting Started
To start using the tool:
1. Go to https://www.decohere.ai/
2. Click 'Login' and made a new account (Signup with Google)
3. Follow their tutorial
4. Start with image prompts
5. Optional: set image size (Wide, Square, or Tall)

Clicking the + button (Add to Library) will save the image at the bottom of the page where you can download it. A saved image can then be hearted to be added to your Favorites tab.

## Image Prompts
Let's start with the most successful prompt from Round 2's image generating.

*Image Prompt #1*:
* "Happy athlete wearing a smartwatch"
>![one watch, holding a phone](./images/decohereAI/hawasw.jpeg)

This inital image is okay, but I count three smartwatches which is definitely too many.

I saw many images flash past as I typed in my prompt, but it ended on this one. You can also click left and right to see other generated images from the same prompt. I am clicking left to cycle through those images and see if it eventually cycles back to the original or generates new ones. I have cycled left 7 times and I will conclude that it does not circle back to the original.

>![man, two watches](./images/decohereAI/hawasw2.jpeg)
![woman, two watches](./images/decohereAI/hawasw3.jpeg)
![woman, one watch](./images/decohereAI/hawasw4.jpeg)
![woman, one watch](./images/decohereAI/hawasw5.jpeg)
![man, blue, two watches](./images/decohereAI/hawasw6.jpeg)
![man, red, two watches](./images/decohereAI/hawasw7.jpeg)

All images appear to be track runners, both male and female, mainly white so far. (This suggests some bias in their training data.) Their poses can be slightly strange, somewhere between in action running down the track and posing for the picture. The main critique is that on most of them, they are actually wearing more than one smartwatch. (When I specified “a” meaning only one in the prompt).

I think I saw better ones before, so I might take away the “smartwatch” part or see if it knows “fitness tracker”.

Let’s also try changing the default image options.

*Image Prompt #2*:
* "Happy athlete wearing a fitness tracker"
* Image size: Square (1:1, Instagram, etc.)
>![one watch, holding a phone](./images/decohereAI/hawaft.jpeg)

There were disappointing results when I first typed in the prompt (no real signs of a fitness tracker and possibly multiple arms in a side picture). But surprisingly, there were much better results once I changed the frame to Square.

Perhaps it really does know what a fitness tracker is better than a smartwatch in terms of an athletics context.

I am satisfied with these images, but with a monthly limit of 1000 images a month (as of time of writing), I am much more confident in my ability to test different prompts.

This time I cycle right. I am curious if I can go back to the left and grab the initial picture on the left? Apparently, I can. That is nice. Being able to simply click on the next available image is kind of fun.

>![one watch, holding a phone](./images/decohereAI/hawaft2.jpeg)
![one watch, holding a phone, front](./images/decohereAI/hawaft3.jpeg)
![one watch, running](./images/decohereAI/hawaft4.jpeg)
![two watches, running](./images/decohereAI/hawaft5.jpeg)
![one watch, pose](./images/decohereAI/hawaft6.jpeg)
![one watch, action](./images/decohereAI/hawaft7.jpeg)
![one watch, action](./images/decohereAI/hawaft8.jpeg)

On closer inspection it appears that a double watch is still appearing.

Next, I’m interested to see if results change if I select the Tall image frame.

*Image Prompt #3*:
* "Happy athlete wearing a fitness tracker"
* Image size: Tall (9:16, Tiktok, etc.)
>![one watch, action](./images/decohereAI/hawaftTALL.jpeg)
![strange hand, tag](./images/decohereAI/hawaftTALL2.jpeg)
![two watches, tag](./images/decohereAI/hawaftTALL3.jpeg)

Entirely new images are generated when switching frames. The page must be zoomed out to see your saved images.

Looking at the new images, you can see the picture tag used when in a photoshoot. (I know from experience since I’ve taken part of one before for a study). Apparently the model has captured that tag, which is an interesting mistake.

Let’s go back to simply “happy athlete.”

*Image Prompt #4*:
* "Happy athlete"
* Image size: Wide (16:9, Youtube, etc.)
>![happy athlete](./images/decohereAI/Happyathlete.jpeg)
![happy athlete, two](./images/decohereAI/Happyathlete2.jpeg)

We get roughly the same images of track runners across all frame sizes.

Time spent: 30 minutes.

## Video Prompts
Let’s get a picture saved in the Favorites tab and try generating a video from it.

1.	Go to the Favorites tab
2.	Click on a picture
3.	Select “Reuse image”
4.	Leave Camera Motion at the default (5.0)
5.	Click Generate Video
6.	Wait for the Queue

Upon refreshing the page, I see the generated output under the all tab.

*Video Prompt #1*:
* (Used a picture from Image Prompt #2)

The video is surreal as the hand moves and fades out of existence. The static pose has been animated to become laughter, which is novel. Under the free plan the videos are 4 seconds. 

I will try more video generations, gradually speeding up the Camera Motion from 0 to 10. Also, I will also try different pictures.

*Video Prompt #2*:
* (Used a picture from Image Prompt #2)
* Camera Motion: 0.0

https://github.com/Aaron-Thai/GenAI/assets/91993827/455cd3c3-aabc-432f-bc08-b2455e2dbfca

The video doesn’t contain much movement. Results are as expected.

*Video Prompt #3*:
* (Used a picture from Image Prompt #2)
* Camera Motion: 1.0

https://github.com/Aaron-Thai/GenAI/assets/91993827/d05eff26-4f8b-45e1-b280-3f4adc10c1db

There is some slow panning in the video, which is nice.

*Video Prompt #4*:
* (Used a picture from Image Prompt #3)
* Camera Motion: 3.0

https://github.com/Aaron-Thai/GenAI/assets/91993827/fcbcbddd-2d46-4b26-9118-4d42b38f2b84

There is some body movement but no mouth movement.

*Video Prompt #5*:
* (Used a picture from Image Prompt #3)
* Camera Motion: 10.0

https://github.com/Aaron-Thai/GenAI/assets/91993827/73ac98b9-e7ef-43ae-97a2-71e2ebcace4d

The static pose has been animated into a running motion, but the face shape morphs and changes halfway through the video, which is a little scary.

*(Between the time of testing and writing, Decohere has added a new feature in their Paid plans to "Use reference person" to generate more consistent images. Perhaps this addresses the issue?)*

Lastly, I'll try generating a new image and then generate a video directly from the result image screen. All the previous images were generated from saved images.

Let's start with a new image prompt.

*Image Prompt #5*:
* "Benefits and challenges of fitness trackers"
* Image size: Wide (16:9, Youtube, etc.)
>![two watches](./images/decohereAI/bacoft.jpeg)
![watch and phone](./images/decohereAI/bacoft1.jpeg)
![watch, running](./images/decohereAI/bacoft2.jpeg)
![running on the phone](./images/decohereAI/bacoft3.jpeg)

Now let's turn the last image into a video.

*Video Prompt #4*:
* (Used a picture from Image Prompt #5)
* Camera Motion: 5.0

https://github.com/Aaron-Thai/GenAI/assets/91993827/282988b3-99a6-4e7d-bcd2-ef520c233593

The output turned out okay. The video appears to be in slow motion, but the model seems to be tuned for the default value of 5.0

## Overall Rating: 3/5
*Decohere* is a generative AI currently marketed towards animated video content, but the free trial restricts access to the most in-depth video tools. Thus, the main strength of this tool at a free tier is the straightforward image generation functionality.

In terms of video generation, the term **Camera Motion** is somewhat self-explanatory, referring to the overall movement in the resulting video, whether that is panning of movement from any characters on screen. Adjustment of this setting required some experimentation before satisfactory output was generated. 

### Image Generation: 3/5
The tool delivers realistic flexbility when provided custom prompts, although not consistently. The 1000 monthly prompt limit also enables further testing with different prompts. The ability to cycle through different images is convenient, but images to not change much once a prompt is typed in.

### Video Generation: 1/5
The tool offers access to brief 4 second animations of static images, which is novel but seems more geared towards usage of stock images rather than people speaking. Realistic video generation of moving people is currently a weakpoint of this tool at free tier, but I would expect significantly enhanced performance on a paid plan.

### Bias: ?/5
One of the most interesting things a person can do with this tool is immedaitely see the bias in the generated images as they type in the prompt, as the images update in realtime with the written prompt.

As demonstrated above, the prompt **"happy athlete"** mainly returns pictures of darker skinned people running in track uniform, suggesting that as the basis for their data. However, once fitness trackers are added into the prompt, such as **"happy athlete wearing a fitness tracker,"** the skin tone of people in the generated images becomes considerably lighter as demonstrated above. Again, this exposes the data the AI model was trained on. 

However, collected data can also reflect societal conditions possibly suggesting that: 
1. Certain demographics of people are more likely seen celebrating victory at global track competitions
2. Certain demographics of people are more likely seen wearing fitness trackers

It is more difficult to formulate a bias score as we have not yet agreed upon what constitutes an acceptable level of bias. As this tool still in its early stages, is it possible that biases can be smoothed out as more data is added into the model.
